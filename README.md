### Separate Applications
- **Senior App**: `localhost:3000` (this app)
- **Family Dashboard**: `localhost:3001/3002` (admin app)
- **When Hosted**: Can be deployed as separate domains (e.g., `app.yoursite.com` and `admin.yoursite.com`)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- Same Supabase database as the family dashboard

### Installation

1. **Clone and setup**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**:
   The app is configured to use the same Supabase instance as the family dashboard for data synchronization.

3. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   The senior app will run on `http://localhost:3000`

### Browser Requirements
